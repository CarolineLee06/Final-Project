## Description
# creates a program that randomly generates or creates a pixel art window using pygame based on a prompt.
# This relates to the digital art and media field through giving people a quick and easy way to generate an art piece. 


## Features
- # Choice to create a random selection or choose from a prompt.
- # Program opens and asks viewer to choose random or prompts.
#  Provides short list of prompts
- # Creates a pixel art window based on imput
- # Given the imput the program will take the imput and output a pixel art
- # The pixel art will draw itsself once its been generated
- # String arguement will be implemented so the pixel art is drawn on the screen once generated.

## Challenges
- # Make sure the prompts in the separate file correspond with the correct 
    # pixel art and that the program outputs that sepcific pixel art
- # Research pygame functions and the moviepy art functions
- # Research how to make the pixel art be drawn in the window once its been generated.

## Outcomes
## Ideal Outcome:
- # the ideal outcome is that the user will imput the prompt or the random prompt and the program will output a 
# pixel drawing based on the prompt given.

## Minimal Viable Outcome:
- # The program takes the prompt imput and outputs a pixel art window in gamepy
