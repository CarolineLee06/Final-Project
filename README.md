# Final-Project

The project code takes an imput from prompting the veiwer to choose either a random 
prompt generated from the prompt list or a specific prompt from the prompt list 
the program will then take the prompt and use it to bring up a pixel art image attached to the prompt. The pygame window will open and the program will draw the pixel art for the viewer.
